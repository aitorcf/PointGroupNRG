PointGroupNRG is a Numerical Renormalization Group code
written entirely in Julia (see [REF_TO_PAPER]). It needs no installation; the
modules are loaded by the scripts. The dependencies are the
Julia packages appearing in `dependencies.jl` and can be
easily installed by running the script (unless a custom
installation is wanted). The user's manual and a tutorial
can be found in the `doc/` directory.
