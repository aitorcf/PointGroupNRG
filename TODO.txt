- Improve "compoundoperators.jl" 

- Re-check thermodynamic calculations with Nz>2

- Convergence of spectral, thermodynamic functions and T_k with 
  cutoff, etafac, widthfac...

- Eliminate non-used/superfluous packages 

- Clean code in "discretization.jl". Revise co2005.
    :: co2005 gives different temperatures for different z

- Eliminate abstract typing

- Fix limits of T in z-averaging 

- Examples:
    :: FO1986

- Thermodata files should be called "thermo_*" instead of
  "th_*"
